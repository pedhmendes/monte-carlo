Projects of Monte Carlo class.

### Group Project - Ehrenfest Model
Done with my colleagues, Gabriela Oliveira and Jo√£o Mesquita. The Jupyter Notebook can be found in this repo, the Colab link can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wgrEgNMEajY78lugJqVN2RftX6Z6jVJh?usp=sharing).


### Ising Model
In Ising's folder can be found different forms to simulate the Ising Model. There is four codes: (1) simple, (2) without matrix, (3) with matrix and (4) bi array. The (1) simple code is the best one, is faster and can be easylly understand. I used the simple in my research, more info [here](https://github.com/pedhmendes/spin-systems-ic). The one (2) without matrix evaluate the energy variation in every step, is not the best way. (3) with matrix code I stored the topology of my system. The last one (4), bi array, uses bidimensional array this one runs very low. 

The ones with GSL flag in the end uses this C library, you can read more [here](https://github.com/pedhmendes/gsl).

There is also available the script to run *n* times, the execution times files, for the ones that did not used the gsl, and also an awk script to evaluate the mean and variance.
